    <h1>UK Online Safety Act:</h1>

    <p>
      The UK Online Safety Act is a new law that requires internet platforms to monitor and remove content deemed <strong>“harmful,”</strong> even if it’s legal. The goal is to protect users, especially minors, but critics warn it risks <strong>mass censorship</strong>, harming free speech and everyday conversations about harmless topics like trains or video games.
    </p>

    <p>
      A petition to repeal the act has gained nearly <strong>480,000 signatures</strong>, forcing a parliamentary debate.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are a UK citizen, support the petition here: 
      <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/722903?reveal_response=yes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #c2a6f9; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;">
        <strong>Read the petition</strong>
      </a>
    </p>

    <p>
      Technology Secretary Peter Kyle said, and I quote, that those who wanted to overturn the act were <strong>“on the side of predators.”</strong> This claim is obviously false and misleading.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is also a problem with the fact that this law will be used as a way for companies and the government to collect your <strong>biometric and personal data</strong> (echem... Google, yeah they love your data) under the excuse <em>“we're protecting the kids.”</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m not sure if governments think we’re idiots, but I hope this doesn’t get any further than it already has and affect other countries. If everyone complains, we might actually be able to do something.

    <h1>My Thoughts</h1>

    <p>
      I'm usually not into politics, but when I see videos like this pop up in my recommended feed, I kind of feel obliged to make it more public than it already is so this <strong>Enshittification of The Internet</strong> doesn’t happen. We already have enough problems with Companies we dont need governments to join in too. 
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Also I know this is a little late and will probably be outdated soon but I still wanted to make this even if barely anyone will see it.</strong>
